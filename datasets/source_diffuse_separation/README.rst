Example Source and Diffuse Datasets
===================================

We add here two files for a large Galactic center region for use in gammapy tutorials to demonstrate the use of the source and
iterative background estimation methods. Note that `diffuse.fits.gz` is a counts map, while `sources.fits.gz` is a flux map.
